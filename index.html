		<h2>Flower History</h2>
			<p>Flowers such as roses, lilies and daisies are used in the expression of love, remembrance or apology on a day to day basis. All through the history of humanity, flowers have been playing a vital role as gifts and for expressing certain gestures. Greeks used to consider flowers to be important as they associated them with the gods. In the 1700s, the importance of flowers increased when French and English people visited Turkey and discovered the language of flowers. The visit gave meaning to the different types of flowers. Based on this, the Victorian culture gave meanings to all flower characteristics.</P>

			<p>The Victorians lived in an era where emotions were not expressed. As a result, flowers became the acceptable means of expression. In the Victorian era, the arrangement, size and colour of flowers conveyed many meanings without people needing to say a word. The way in which a person held or presented a flower also held a lot of meaning. Books were written during this period to help people decode the meaning of flowers. What is expressed in emails and text messages today, could be conveyed using a single flower. Floral design messages also differ from some arrangements to the others.</p>

			<p>The history of flower giving is still being written. Once upon a time, the idea of a woman giving flowers to a man was inconceivable. However, that has changed with time. There are many internet florists who find ways of delivering flowers to any location in the world. Moreover, there have been scientific advances which have made it possible to have a year-round supply of all flower types. Even if many people do not know what most flowers mean, they still give them out to show certain gestures. People mostly use flowers to convey various sentiments and to decorate their homes.</p>
